/**
 * audit-dark-surfaces.mjs — catch dark surfaces the light-mode mapping cannot.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * ---------------
 * `script/build-light-theme.mjs` remaps every dark COLOUR UTILITY to a light
 * equivalent. It works on class names, so it is blind to an inline style:
 *
 *     <div style={{ background: '#02060E' }}>   ← untouchable by CSS mapping
 *
 * On 2026-09-02 there were 47 of those across 25 files. Twelve were admin
 * screens — the academy modal, the session roll, the NZF identity fields, the
 * admin loading screen — each a full-page or full-panel near-black that would
 * keep its background while the mapping correctly flipped the text on top of
 * it to dark ink. Black text on a black panel: the "View ClubOS as…" bug,
 * repeated a dozen times, and invisible to any grep for classes.
 *
 *   npx tsx script/audit-dark-surfaces.mjs      (or: node)
 *
 * Exits 1 if an un-declared dark surface exists.
 *
 * A page that IS meant to be dark declares it, one of two ways:
 *   • its route is listed in `isPublicDarkSurface()` in lib/theme-provider.tsx
 *     — preferred, because it applies before first paint; or
 *   • it renders `<ForceDarkSurface />` — for a page whose URL cannot identify
 *     it, like the SIU camp page, which shares `/{slug}` with the light CUFC
 *     one.
 * Either way it must appear in DECLARED_DARK below, so that "this page is
 * deliberately black" is a decision somebody wrote down.
