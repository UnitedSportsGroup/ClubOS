// PRE-DEPLOY GUARD — refuse to ship a branch that would delete a live feature.
//
//   npx tsx --env-file=.env script/preflight-deploy.ts
//
// Why this exists. The Fly app `clubos` serves WHATEVER BRANCH YOU DEPLOY, so a
// branch cut before someone else's merge silently removes their feature from
// production. It is not hypothetical — it has now happened three times:
//   • AttributionOS  — /t.js reverted to serving HTML, days of lost data
//   • squads:read    — reverted TWICE (v394–397, then v399), each time silently
//   • parent accounts— removed 2026-08-09 by a deploy of feat/notifications,
//                      which was cut before it. Found by Daniel, not by us.
// Every one was found by a human noticing something broken, because a missing
// route looks exactly like a route that was never there.
//
// The check: ask PRODUCTION what it currently serves, then confirm the code
// about to be deployed still serves all of it. Anything prod answers and this
// working tree does not is a REMOVAL, and removals fail the check.
//
// This deliberately probes the live site rather than reading git history — the
// question is never "did I merge the right branch", it is "will production
// still do everything it does today".
