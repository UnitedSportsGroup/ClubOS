// PROGRAMME & PAYMENT HISTORY — every term a person signed up for, and every
// dollar actually recorded against them.
//
// Built 2026-08-12 (Daniel): the office could see a family's links but not what
// they had ever bought. Accounts needs the transaction history, the football
// side needs the programme history, and a loyalty scheme needs both.
//
// THE ONE RULE, as with resolveFamily(): both the player page and the parent
// page resolve history through resolvePeopleHistory() here. Four sources record
// what a family bought, and a page that reads one of them is how "No programmes"
// ended up under a child with two terms and a $160 card payment on file:
//
//   fm_registration_history   10,294 rows — 10 years of FM terms, 3,194 people
//   fm_payment_history         9,624 rows — $1.21m, 2017-08-09 → 2026-07-05
//   registrations              ClubOS term enrolments (the person IS contact_id)
//   registration_items         holiday camps (the child is a `children` row)
//
// ── The money rules, which are the whole point ───────────────────────────────
//
// 🔴 A PAYMENT BELONGS TO THE PERSON NAMED ON IT. fm_payment_history.contact_id
//    points at the PLAYER, not the payer: 8,528 payments ($981k) sit against
//    player-type contacts and 666 against guardians, and the row's own
//    first/last name matches that contact on all 9,195 joinable rows. So a
//    child's page shows their own payments, and a parent's total is the sum of
//    their children's — not a re-reading of the same rows from the other side.
//
// 🔴 A MULTI-CHILD BOOKING IS COUNTED ONCE AND NEVER SPLIT. 36 live camp
//    registrations cover 2–3 children under one total_cents, and
//    registration_items.price_cents is NULL on 779 of 834 lines — there is no
//    per-child price to divide by, and an even split would invent one (a child
//    on a half day did not pay what their sibling on a full day paid). Each
//    child's row carries the booking, and the household adds it once.
//
// 🔴 THE ABSENCE OF A PAYMENT IS NOT EVIDENCE OF NON-PAYMENT. Payments and term
//    registrations only agree on term_name 58% of the time (5,969 of 10,294
//    registrations match; 5,612 payments match no registration for that person).
//    So there is deliberately NO paid/unpaid badge. Where a term-name match
//    exists it is shown as supporting evidence; where it doesn't, the page says
//    nothing rather than telling the accounts team a family didn't pay.
//
// 🔴 TOTALS COME FROM REAL PAYMENT ROWS, never from a status. A "confirmed"
//    registration with amount_paid 0.00 is the normal camp shape (367 of 535
//    live registrations), so inferring payment from status would invent revenue.
