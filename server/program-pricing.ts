// Program pricing engine. Same shape as print-pricing — one pure function
// callable from server and used to drive the public registration price
// preview. Server is the source of truth; the client uses it for display
// only and the price is re-validated server-side before Stripe charges.
//
// Models:
//   - flat: pay the full fee regardless of when you join
//   - term_prorated: discount based on sessions still to come in the term
//   - per_day: holiday camps charge per day attended (handled elsewhere)
