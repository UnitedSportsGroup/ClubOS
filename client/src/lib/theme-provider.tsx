// 🔴 ClubOS ADMIN IS LIGHT ONLY (Daniel, 2026-09-02).
//
// Dark mode was a per-user toggle. Staff complained about the dark rendering
// constantly and nobody has ever complained about light, because a large part
// of this codebase was written dark-first with hardcoded colours
// (`bg-slate-950`, `text-white`, `border-white/10`) rather than tokens — so
// light mode was being patched at the CSS level and leaked black-on-black
// panels wherever the patch didn't reach. One theme, rendered properly, beats
// two themes where one is broken.
//
// Nothing here is deleted. The `.dark` token block still lives in index.css
// and this provider still knows how to resolve and apply a dark theme. To
// bring the toggle back: flip ADMIN_DARK_MODE to true, and re-add the toggle
// button to the profile menu (it was removed from the sidebar footer in the
// same change).
const ADMIN_DARK_MODE = false;

// Theme preference is stored as one of these. Retained for when the toggle
// comes back; while ADMIN_DARK_MODE is false the stored value is ignored.

// 🔴 EVERY dark-designed public page must be listed here.
//
// Admin used to be light-or-dark by preference, so these pages were dark for
// a dark-mode user and already wrong for a light-mode one. Making admin light
// by default would have made them wrong for EVERYONE: the light mapping flips
// their `text-white/70` to dark ink while their own hardcoded `#02060E`
// background stays black, which is the unreadable-panel bug in a full page.
//
// Found by auditing inline `style={{ background: '#…' }}` — a class-based
// mapping cannot reach an inline style, so grepping for classes would have
// missed all of them. `scripts/audit-dark-surfaces.mjs` is that audit, kept.
