  // --commit`; it needs no deploy and takes effect on the next request.
  "budget", // Phase 1 construction — staff salaries visible. Daniel only.
  // Coding Budget — the chart of accounts. Same reason as `budget`, and more
  // specific: code 21-01 lists eleven roles by title against a salary each
  // (Chief Executive $150,000, Academy Director $115,000, Business Development
  // Manager $72,000), and 21-04 does the same for eight contractors. Removing
  // this line would hand the club's payroll to every United Sports Group admin,
  // because a workspace admin bypasses the tabs whitelist entirely. Grant
  // Victor — or anyone else — by name with script/grant-unlocked-tab.ts; it
  // takes effect on the next request and needs no deploy.
  "coding-budget",
  // Sporty / NZF NRS push: sends children's identity data to a national
  // register, and a mis-click during UAT could create real NRS records.
  // Daniel-only until the integration passes UAT and the deeds are signed.
  "sporty",
  "cashflow", // Club-wide cashflow insight (Xero patterns, wage-level data). Daniel only.
  "projects", // Work Management System v1 — launched dark while Daniel shapes it. Remove to open to admins/managers.
  "business-plan", // MFL business plan + who-opened-it access log — Daniel only for privacy. Remove to open to admins/managers.
  "club-dossier", // Sandbox — first-party people intelligence (PII across all programs). Daniel only.
  "invoices", // Tracked invoices — carries bank details. Daniel only while it's shaped.
  // "payouts" UNLOCKED 2026-07-23 (Daniel): the tab now follows the normal
  // permission system — workspace role + the per-member tabs whitelist set in
  // Team (first grant: Olga, USG team_member with tabs:["payouts"]).
  // Fleet — names a staff member against a licence number, a home address and
  // an FBT private-use position. STAYS LOCKED. Ryan Edwards and Travis Graham
  // were let in individually (2026-08-18) via user_organizations.unlocked_tabs,
  // because deleting this line would also hand it to the other six United
  // Sports Group admins — a workspace admin bypasses the tabs whitelist.
  // Grant the next person with script/grant-unlocked-tab.ts; no deploy needed.
  "vehicles",
  // Equipment Register — carries every coordinator's name, personal email and
  // mobile, and a per-team judgement of whether gear went missing on their
  // watch. Same reasoning as Vehicles: removing this line would hand it to all
  // eight United Sports Group admins, because a workspace admin bypasses the
  // tabs whitelist. Ryan Edwards and Travis Graham were let in individually
  // (2026-08-18) via user_organizations.unlocked_tabs. Grant the next person
  // with script/grant-unlocked-tab.ts; no deploy needed.
  "equipment",
  // Fines — names a person or a vehicle against money owed, and carries the
  // scanned notice. Same class of data as vehicles/housing. Daniel + Travis
  // only (2026-08-21), by name via user_organizations.unlocked_tabs.
  "fines",
  // Accommodation (slug `housing`): occupants' names and emails, what each owes,
  // bond, key codes for every room, and which players are still unverified.
  // Without this lock every *admin* of the group workspace would see it — the
  // tabs whitelist does not restrain a workspace admin. Same class of data as
  // budget/cashflow, plus door codes. Grant an individual with
  // script/grant-unlocked-tab.ts rather than removing this line.
  "housing",
  // Friendly Manager History — 10 years of children's enrolment records and
  // family payment history (imported 2026-07-14). Daniel-only while he shapes
  // it. Remove this line to open it to CUFC admins/managers.
  "fm-history",
  // Competitions history — carries team-manager phones/emails; Daniel-only.

/**
 * Whether a user should see/access a given tab in a workspace.
 * Rules:
 *   - Locked tabs (SUPER_ADMIN_ONLY_TABS) → super_admin, or a person named in
 *     that membership's `unlockedTabs`. A ROLE never opens a locked tab.
 *   - super_admin always sees everything
 *   - admin or manager role → all tabs (full access regardless of tabs column)
 *   - tabs == null → all tabs (legacy default; treat as full access)
 *   - tabs is array → whitelist match
 *
 * 🔴 `membershipUnlockedTabs` is the ONLY way past the lock other than being a
 * super admin, and it is deliberately a separate column from `membershipTabs`.
 * The whitelist is bypassed entirely for an admin/manager membership (see the
 * third rule), so a locked tab granted through it would be granted to every
 * admin in the workspace — which is the whole thing the lock exists to stop.
 * It also has to be a column no other feature writes: Dima's group membership
 * carries tabs = ["budget"] from an old grant, inert only because "budget" is
 * locked, and honouring `tabs` here would have handed him the salary data.
 *
 * Omitting the argument fails CLOSED — a caller that has not been taught about
 * locked-tab grants denies access rather than leaking one.
