/**
 * Team Pay — the shared decider for team entries, squad payment and fill-ins.
 *
 * Built 2026-08-27 from Isaac Living's spec (13 Aug Tournament Planning Meeting):
 * a team manager needs to see who on their squad has paid, nudge the ones who
 * haven't, and pull in a fill-in when they're short. Piloting on the Christchurch
 * Ethnic Cup, then MFL and CIC 7's — so nothing in here knows about a specific
 * competition.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS: the per-player share, the three statuses the manager
 * sees, and whether an entry is paid up are each computed in more than one place
 * (server charging, server email, manager dashboard, player page, admin board).
 * They are declared ONCE here. A second implementation is how "you owe $57" and
 * "you owe $67" end up on the same screen.

 * figure per player. And deliberately rounded UP so the squad's shares can never
 * sum to less than the fee: the club must not be a cent short because 800/14
 * doesn't divide. The overflow (at most squadSize-1 cents) is the last payer's
 * problem in every split system there is, and here it is at most 13c.
