 * What we can HONESTLY say about one registration's money.
 *
 * 🔴 There is deliberately no "you owe $X" state, and no account-level balance.
 * Probed against prod 2026-08-04:
 *     confirmed          414 registrations — only 169 have any amount_paid
 *     pending            116 registrations — 0 have any amount_paid
 *     partially_refunded   4 — 0 have any amount_paid
 * `amount_paid` is simply not maintained: the camp checkout never set it, and
 * office walk-ups did not set it until v372. So `total_cents − amount_paid`
 * would have told ~245 families who have ALREADY PAID that they owed money,
 * and 116 people who abandoned a checkout that they owed us $23,649.
 *
 * A wrong balance on a parent's own screen is worse than no balance. Until the
 * payments ledger is trustworthy, this reports what each registration IS and
 * what the fee WAS, and claims a shortfall only where a real part-payment is
 * actually recorded.
