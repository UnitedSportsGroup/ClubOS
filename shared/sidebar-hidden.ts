/**
 * Which tabs the sidebar does not draw, regardless of permissions.
 *
 * Lifted out of app-sidebar.tsx on 2026-09-03. A tab has to clear TWO gates to
 * be visible: `canAccessTab` (may this person reach it?) and these lists (do we
 * draw it at all?). Keeping the second gate inside a React component meant no
 * script could see it — `script/access-review.ts` reported Studio as newly
 * visible to nine people on the day it was hidden from every sidebar.
 *
 * Permission tooling and the sidebar now read the SAME source.

  // person's own profile (/admin/people/:key → resolvePeopleHistory reads
  // fm_registration_history + fm_payment_history directly), which is reachable
  // from Contacts and global search — and by MORE people than this tab was,
  // since the tab is super-admin-only and Contacts is not.

  // 🔴 NOT hidden: "fm-competitions". Verified 2026-09-02 — NOTHING else in
  // ClubOS reads fm_competition_*. MFL's Competitions page reads the live
  // `league_competitions` table and CIC's reads `tournaments`; neither touches
  // the archive. Hiding this tab would make 41 competitions, 695 teams, 2,508
  // games, 248 placings and the CIC club-loyalty ledger unreachable in the UI.
  // It stays until that history is surfaced in the MFL and CIC workspaces.
  //
  // ✅ "cufc-mailer" (Newsletters) is GONE from this workspace entirely
  // (Daniel, 2026-09-09) — removed from tabs.ts, the sidebar and App.tsx
  // rather than hidden. The 2026-09-02 note here argued against it because
  // Newsletters reached Play Predictor entrants that Mailer's guardian-only
  // "all" segment misses. Measured before removal: 7 entrants have ever given
  // marketing consent and 2 are already guardians, so the real loss was FIVE
  // addresses, against a live risk of picking the wrong one of two boxes both
  // labelled "email the families". Mailer had sent every real campaign;
  // Newsletters had sent none in two months. If Play Predictor ever grows,
  // give Mailer a "predictor" segment — do not bring back a second sender.
